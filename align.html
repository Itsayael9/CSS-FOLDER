   <h4>text-align: justify; is a CSS property that aligns text so that it stretches to fit the full width of its container. This means:

    The text will have straight edges on both the left and right sides.
    Spaces between words will be adjusted to ensure that each line (except the last line) fills the entire width.
    This creates a neat, block-like appearance for paragraphs of text. Itâ€™s often used in newspapers and magazines for a more formal look. If you have any more questions about text alignment or anything else, feel free to ask!
